# Event Monitoring Code Extension

### By Mateusz Seredyn

About
=====

This Repo contains MATLAB scripts written as part of a Research Master's Degree at the University of Bristol.
The scripts are designed handle Elastic 3D waveform modelling SAC files as well as traditionally generated sesimic SAC files.
These scripts were made based on structures and functions from the University of Bristol School of Earth Science's in house seismic monitoring code.

How To Use
==========

First of all you need access to MATLAB and UOB EventMon code. <br />
Secondly use `> help [function name]` to see each script / function's document and use guides.

Feel free to contact me with any questions!
